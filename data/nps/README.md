# Context
The National Park Service publishes a database of animal and plant species identified in individual national parks and verified by evidence â€” observations, vouchers, or reports that document the presence of a species in a park. All park species records are available to the public on the National Park Species portal; exceptions are made for sensitive, threatened, or endangered species when widespread distribution of information could pose a risk to the species in the park.

# Content
National Park species lists provide information on the presence and status of species in our national parks. These species lists are works in progress and the absence of a species from a list does not necessarily mean the species is absent from a park. The time and effort spent on species inventories varies from park to park, which may result in data gaps. Species taxonomy changes over time and reflects regional variations or preferences; therefore, records may be listed under a different species name.

Each park species record includes a species ID, park name, taxonomic information, scientific name, one or more common names, record status, occurrence (verification of species presence in park), nativeness (species native or foreign to park), abundance (presence and visibility of species in park), seasonality (season and nature of presence in park), and conservation status (species classification according to US Fish & Wildlife Service). Taxonomic classes have been translated from Latin to English for species categorization; order, family, and scientific name (genus, species, subspecies) are in Latin.
