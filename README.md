# LA-Crime-Analysis

For this project, CSVS of crime data and homelessness data in Los Angeles from 2012-2016 were analyzed to see if a correlation between the two could be found.  There was a multitude of different crimes so it was decided that using four common crime typess would be more useful to the analysis.  These four crimes were Assualt with a Deadly Weapon (AWD), Theft, Battery, and Vandalism.  Using Pandas and Matplotlib, the count of each crime type was type was taken for each year to see if there were any significant increases or decreases.  From 2012 to 2014 there was a general increase in most crimes, followed by a general decrease in 2015 and 2016.  It should be noted that one reason for the decrease in these later years was missing data in the winter months of these years.  The same general trend was seen in the total count of all crimes per year.  This was then compared using a bar graph and line graph to the count of homeless persons in each of these same years.  Homelessness seemed to generally inceased throughout all five years, even during the stark decrease in crimes in 2015 and 2016.  Although not entirely conclusive, there does not seem to be a correlation bewteen crime and homelessness in Los Angeles.
